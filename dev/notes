# ID mapping

Using the beta web app, use the ID mapper. Then click on the 'Download' button.
Then click on 'generate URL for API'. This gives 2 ways to obtain the results
which you should put into the function. This sort of helps explain the two
ways of downloading results described in this page https://beta.uniprot.org/help/id_mapping.

Also see more info about the paginated results here https://beta.uniprot.org/help/pagination
